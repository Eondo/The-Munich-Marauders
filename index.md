## Welcome fellow muggle!
We are the Munich local chapter of the [Harry Potter and the Sacred Text Podcast](https://www.harrypottersacredtext.com). We meet regularily to treat the Harry Potter books as sacred, to build a community of love, respect and thoughtfulness. We support trans-liberation and oppose J.K. Rowlings hateful rethoric on the issue. We are not a cult, but of course that is what a cult would say, isn't it?
