## Welcome fellow muggle!
We are the Munich local chapter of the [Harry Potter and the Sacred Text Podcast](https://www.harrypottersacredtext.com). We meet regularily to treat the Harry Potter books as sacred, to build a community of love, respect and thoughtfulness. We support trans-liberation and oppose J.K. Rowlings hateful rethoric on the issue. We are not a cult, but of course that is what a cult would say, isn't it?

**Reach out to us** via contact@munichmarauders.org, or join our [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/2408737062515597/).

**Our next Meeting** will take place at 4 pm on Saturday Feb 27 and focus on book 3, chapter 8 *Flight of the fat lady* through the theme of *desperation*, using *sacred imagination*. Attention: This meeting will be the first one to take place on *Discord* instead of *Zoom*.

**Meeting Agenda:** Due to the pandemic we are currently meeting via *Discord*, reach out to us if you want to join a meeting. We start each session by *solemly swearing we are up to no good* and by - anyone who feels comfortable doing so - sharing a personal thorn and rose from since the previous meeting. Before entering the theme discussions, one of the participants does a *thirty-second-recap* of the current chapter. After the person moderating the day's meeting guides us through the theme discussion, we finish it off with a sacred practice, followed by each of the participants blessing a character from the chapter. After a short *miscellaneous* section which mostly focusses on group-organisation, we officially finish the meeting with *mischief managed*, before we let the session derail into our many - optional - muggle studies tangents.

**Short Statement on the issue of transphobia:** The Munich Marauders want to make clear that we stand unitedly against JKR’s and any other transphobia. Trans rights are human rights. We believe that the Harry Potter books teach us a different story than what JKR is perpetuating: the books teach us a story of love and acceptance, of finding your true self and being comfortable in that, of Hogwarts as a safe home for everyone. Sacred reading has nothing to do with the author or her intent – the text belongs to the readers, all of us. We, the readers and interpreters, make it magic. And that is why we as the Munich Marauders feel comfortable condemning JKR in her transphobia, but still gathering around the books. They aren’t her books, they are ours. And they have inspired us to love more and better. To take care of our friends at the margins. To fight for what’s right. As Jackson Bird so pointedly said: *“The real magic for me is what people have created around the books and the community we have built together.”* (Jackson Bird, NYT, Dec. 21, 2019). **Some ressources** we found helpful are
