## Welcome fellow muggle!
We are the Munich local chapter of the [Harry Potter and the Sacred Text Podcast](https://www.harrypottersacredtext.com). We meet regularily to treat the Harry Potter books as sacred, to build a community of love, respect and thoughtfulness. We support trans-liberation and oppose J.K. Rowlings hateful rethoric on the issue. We are not a cult, but of course that is what a cult would say, isn't it?

**Our next Meeting** will be on book 3, chapter 7 *The Boggart in the Wardrobe* through the theme of *humor*, using *sacred imagination*. Due to the pandemic we are currently meeting via *Zoom*. We open the theme discussions by *solemly swearing we are up to no good* and by - anyone who feels comfortable doing so - sharing a personal thorn and rose  from since the previous meeting. We end the theme discussions with *mischief managed*, before we let the session derail into our many - optional - muggle studies tangents. 

[Check out](https://munich-marauders-fanfiction.tumblr.com/) the **wholesome fanfiction** written by one of our members.
