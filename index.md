## Welcome fellow muggle!
We are the Munich local chapter of the [Harry Potter and the Sacred Text Podcast](https://www.harrypottersacredtext.com). We meet regularily to treat the Harry Potter books as sacred, to build a community of love, respect and thoughtfulness. We support trans-liberation and oppose J.K. Rowlings hateful rethoric on the issue. We are not a cult, but of course that is what a cult would say, isn't it?

**Our next Meeting** will take place at 4 pm on Sunday Feb 21 and focus on book 3, chapter 7 *The Boggart in the Wardrobe* through the theme of *humor*, using *sacred imagination*. 

**Meeting Agenda:** Due to the pandemic we are currently meeting via *Zoom*. We start each session by *solemly swearing we are up to no good* and by - anyone who feels comfortable doing so - sharing a personal thorn and rose from since the previous meeting. Before entering the theme discussions, one of the participants does a *thirty-second-recap* of the current chapter. After the person moderating the day's meeting guides us through the theme discussion, we finish it off with a sacred practice, followed by each of the participants blessing a character from the chapter. After a short *miscellaneous* section which mostly focusses on group-organisation, we officially finish the meeting with *mischief managed*, before we let the session derail into our many - optional - muggle studies tangents.
